# Student Dashboard Application

This application provides a simple student management system with the following functionalities:

## Features Implemented/Fixed:

*   **Add New Students:** Users can now successfully register and add new student records through the dashboard form. New students appear correctly in the student list.

*   **Update Student Information:** Existing student records can be updated. When a student's 'Edit' button is clicked, their details populate the form, allowing for modifications. The 'SAVE' button transforms into an 'UPDATE' button, and changes are saved to the database.

*   **Delete Students:** Students can be removed from the system using the 'Delete' action button next to their record.

*   **Improved Form Handling & Error Feedback:**
    *   The 'SAVE' button in the student form now provides proper client-side and server-side error messages if adding a new student fails.
    *   The 'UPDATE' operation also provides more detailed error messages and automatically clears the form and resets the 'UPDATE' button to 'SAVE' if the update fails, ensuring a cleaner user experience.
    *   The 'CANCEL' button consistently clears the form and resets it to the 'SAVE' (add new student) state.

*   **Action Button Layout Fix:** The 'Edit' and 'Delete' action buttons in the student list table are now displayed side-by-side for better visual organization.

To run this project, you will need the following software and dependencies:

1. Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):
   - Download: Visit the official Node.js website and download the recommended LTS version for your operating system. npm is bundled with Node.js.
   - Website: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Project Dependencies (Node.js packages):
   - Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js.
   - EJS (Embedded JavaScript): A templating engine.
   - sqlite3: SQLite database driver for Node.js.

   To install these, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal (where `app.js` is located) and run the following command:

   - npm install express ejs sqlite3


3. Database:
   - This project uses SQLite, which is a self-contained, file-based database. You do not need to install a separate database server. The `sqlite3` npm package will handle database interactions.

Steps to Run the Project:

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Install project dependencies by running:

   - npm install

   (This will install `express`, `ejs`, and `sqlite3` if they are listed in a `package.json` file. If `package.json` is not present or if you want to be explicit, use `npm install express ejs sqlite3` as shown above.)
4. Start the application by running:

   - node app.js

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port your `app.js` is configured to use).
